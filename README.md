# CHEME7770-Project
The attached codes are used for the final project from CHEME7770: Advanced Principles of Biomolecular Engineering


"TCLM- MERS-CoV.jl" and "TCLM- SARS-CoV-2.jl" were the fundamental codes we used to simulate the replications behavior of MERS-Cov and SARS-CoV-2 by adapting the Target Cell Limited Model (TCLM).


"MERS-CoV-IFN.jl" and "SARS-CoV-2-IFN.jl" were used to observe the inteferon response on MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in TCLM.


"MERS-CoV inhibition.jl" and "SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.jl" were used to identify the inhibition effects of ubiquitin variants in TCLM.


"MERS-CoV-inhibition-IFN.jl" and "SARS-CoV-2-inhibtion-IFN.jl" were used to compare the effects of IFN response along with inhibition in TCLM.


The matlab file "epsilon.m" was used to generate the dose responses from ubiquituin variants.


Lastly, "Michaelis.m" was used to replicate the Deubiquitinating and DelSGlyation activity curves from the ubiquituin variants.
